      <!--Intro-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Foundation is a responsive front-end framework that makes it easier for web developers to quickly add dynamic elements to a webpage.  It is important to have a general understanding of what this means before jumping into the tutorial.  Web development is divided into two parts called the front-end, or client side, and the back-end, or server side.  The front-end is everything that is seen in the browser when surfing the web.  It provides a visual interaction for the user and
        is the bridge that connects the user to the back-end, where all of the heavy computing and data management takes place.  Three front-end web technologies for developing web applications are HTML, CSS and Javascript.  For an in-depth look at these technologies, head to <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, a great site for learning these languages.  HTML and CSS give web developers the ability to create static websites that can look great, but don't give the
        user much interaction.  Javascript makes the website dynamic, allowing changes to occur based on user interaction.  Javascript is a proper programming language, unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup languages.  Because of this, Javascript takes more time and effort to learn and write.  Foundation solves this problem by having built in Javascript and CSS.  Dynamic elements can easily be added by using HTML alone.  This is done by adding proper attributes to the HTML tags.  Finally, responsiveness refers to the ability of a webpage
        to change dynamically according to different screen sizes.  This is an important aspect in a world of tablets and smartphones.  Foundation handles this automatically for the developer.  This will all be discussed in the following sections.</p>

      <!--Getting Started-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>The first thing to do when beginning Foundation is download the framework from Zurb's <a href = "http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation Website.</a> For beginners, it is recommended to download the basic version that does not involve using Sass.  Doing this provides a folder that contains other various files.  The important file to begin working with is the index.html file.  After opening this file with a preferred text editor, it can be seen that a beginning
        framework was been provided to the developer.  The necessary beginning HTML tags are already in place and the necessary CSS and Javascript files have been provided.  This can be seen in the image below.  Because Foundation provides all of this from the start, the develepor can immediately move on to creating a dynamic webpage. The developer can completely ignore the CSS and Javascript files to do this because Foundation contains a library of specific class names to add as
        HTML tag attributes.  To begin, move to the section after the first body tag in the index.html file and begin adding tags and attributes by following the steps in the next sections.</p>

      <!--Top Bar-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Top Bar</h2>
        <p>Foundation has an inbuilt system for making a top bar for easier navigation. Foundation allows to easily add a top bar with links to different pages.The first thing to do is to have a nav tag with class top-bar, a foundation specific attribute named data-topbar and a role attribute with value navigation. To have a title in the top bar with an unordered list with class title-area with a list item with class name. Then add a section tag with unordered lists within it for left and right aligned menu items with right or left class names respectively. Every list item within this will be added as menu items on the top bar. There are also options to add dropdown item. This is in the example below.</p>

      <!--Off canvas menu-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Off canvas menu</h2>
        <p>The Off-Canvas menu is great for fitting a lot of elements on a small screen. It is ideal for the mobile view as it keeps the navigation off the screen until the user asks to see it. The Off-Canvas menu is made up of a tab bar with at least the toggle menu button. You can also add a title or links to the bar if you want. The menu itself is an unordered list of all the links or elements you want in the menu. The entire site needs to be wrapped in a couple divs for the menu to slide in correctly. Check out the example below for an idea of how it works.</p>

      </div>
      <!--Grid system-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Grid system</h2>
        <p>The backbone of foundation is the grid system. This system enables a programmer to write a website that is compatible with both mobile and desktop browsers. There are three different parts to this system; the mobile grid, the desktop grid, and the block grid. HTML div elements are what Foundation uses as the building blocks for a website. Div elements hold the different types of website elements that a programmer may want to display and they are selected using the class attribute. A div element with the class “row” will be a container for columns of a grid. Inside this element, we are able to nest other div elements with the class “column” that will serve as columns in a table. By default, Foundation divides the screen into 12 blocks across, and this tutorial will do the same.</p>
      </div>
      <!--Mobile Grid-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Mobile Grid</h2>
        <p>The mobile grid is the type of grid that will be displayed when the browser window that the website is being displayed on is 768px wide or less. In order to specify the number of blocks wide you want your column element to be on a small screen like this, you use the “small-#” class, where # is a number from 1 to 12. All of the column widths of the columns in a row must add up to 12 in order for the table to be centered within the web page. For example, say we want to make two columns, the first of which is 4 blocks wide, and the second is 8 blocks wide. We will use the following code snippet:</p>
        <div class="code">
          &lt;div class=”row”&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”small-4 columns”&gt;Column 1&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”small-8 columns”&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &lt;/div&gt;
        </div>
        <p>The 4 and 8 specify the width of the column, and the word “small” specifies that this size is for when the screen is less 768px wide or less. The next aspect to cover is what to do when the screen is larger than 768px. This is where the desktop grid comes into the picture.</p>
        <iframe height='500' scrolling='no' src='http://codepen.io/Avanyx/embed/BNOKjp/?height=500&theme-id=17075&default-tab=html' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/Avanyx/pen/BNOKjp/'>Adding some content / small grid</a> by Dalton Mankin (<a href='http://codepen.io/Avanyx'>@Avanyx</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
        </iframe>
      </div>
      <!--Desktop Grid-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Desktop Grid</h2>
        <p>The desktop grid is just like the mobile grid except it is the grid that is displayed when the screen is larger than 768px wide. Instead of “small” in the class name, we will use the word “large.” Here is an example of code that will generate one column that is 5 blocks wide and another that is 7 blocks wide on a large screen:</p>
        <div class="code">&lt;div class=”row”&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”large-5 columns”&gt;Column 1&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”large-7 columns”&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &lt;/div&gt;</div>
        <p>Again, the number of blocks adds up to 12 for this row, which ensures that the content will effectively fill the entire width of the screen. The mobile grid and the desktop grid are both useful on their own, but they reach their full potential when used together.</p>

      </div>
      <!--Mobile and Desktop Working together-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Mobile and Desktop Working Together</h2>
        <p>Using the mobile grid and desktop grid together ensures that a page will be look great on both small and large screens. In order to put these two concepts together, all that needs to be done is use both the “small” and “large” keywords within the class of a particular column element. Below is an example of code that will generate two columns. On a small screen, the first column will be 4 blocks wide, while on a large screen is will be 5 blocks wide. The second column will be 8 blocks wide on a small screen and 7 blocks wide on a large screen.</p>
        <div class="code">&lt;div class=”row”&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”large-5 columns”&gt;Column 1&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=”large-7 columns”&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &lt;/div></div>
        <p>Again, the number of blocks adds up to 12 for this row, which ensures that the content will effectively fill the entire width of the screen. The mobile grid and the desktop grid are both useful on their own, but they reach their full potential when used together.</p>

        </iframe>
      </div>
      <!--Block Grid-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Block Grid</h2>
        <p>The block grid is very similar to the mobile and desktop grid system, except that it resizes content based on a fixed number of elements across. For example, if you wanted to display a row of 3 images that each took up ⅓ of the screen, the block grid would be the solution. As the mobile and desktop grid used div element for the row and columns, the block grid uses an unordered list. Another similarity between these two systems is the “small” and “large” keywords. Here is some code that will display 8 images. On a large screen, each image will take up ¼ of the screen, so there will be 4 across. On a small screen, each image will take up ½ of the screen, so there will be 2 across.</p>
        <div class="code">&lt;ul class="small-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-4"&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image5.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image6.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image7.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="image8.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &lt;/ul&gt;</div>
        <p>Here, as the screen size changes, as long as it is less than or equal to 768px wide, 2 images will fill the screen width, resizing the images to achieve this. When the screen is larger than this, 4 images will take up the width and be resized automatically to fill the width.</p>

      <!--Buttons-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p>Adding neatly styled and colorful buttons is made very easy with Foundation. Buttons can easily be added with an anchor tag with a button class. This generates a simple button with the text displayed on the button. Adding more classes to this will style the buttons even more. For example, adding a tiny, small, large, expanded, round and radius classes will style the buttons accordingly. Also adding classes like success (green), secondary (gray), alert (red) etc… adds color to the button. By listing the buttons as list items in an unordered list with class button-group will make a button group.</p>

      </div>
      <!--Plugins-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Plugins</h2>
        <p>Foundation also comes with a lot of plugins that uses JavaScript (a client side programming language). They include tabs, dropdowns, accordions, orbit, abide validation, modals, tooltips etc… These help to make a website to be more functional and organized. Some of these plugins are described in the following sections. For more plugins, the Zurb Foundation official documentation will be very helpful.</p>
      </div>
      <!--Orbit-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Orbit</h2>
        <p>Traditional ways of adding an image slider is very complicated compared to what Foundation offers. Orbit helps with making image sliders in a very intuitive and simple way. Although orbit is no longer officially supported by (no more updates) Zurb (the group that designed Foundation), it will still be part of the package. To use an orbit, simply add an unordered list with the foundation specific attribute data-orbit. Then, add images as list items. It is also possible to add a caption by adding a div with the class orbit-caption within the list tag for each image. The caption goes within the div tags.</p>

      <!--Modals-->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Modals</h2>
        <p>Modals are useful as pop ups or alerts. They show up over top of the page and can be dismissed without affecting the page beneath. Foundation also makes it very simple to implement. You simply add the attribute “data-reveal-id” with the name of the class that contains the content of the modal and you are all set go. Check out the example below to see it all written out.</p>
